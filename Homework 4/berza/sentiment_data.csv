	ALKALOID AD Skopje invests in South Korean research and development company

ALKALOID AD Skopje invests in South Korean research and development company
As an international generic pharmaceutical company, ALKALOID AD Skopje aims to be present
in all segments of the industry and provide healthcare systems and patients with access to a wide
range of medications at affordable prices. In addition to offering generic medicines, ALKALOID
AD Skopje has set a strategic objective to introduce biosimilar drugs to the market.
To capitalize on this growing business segment in the pharmaceutical industry, ALKALOID AD
has decided to invest in the South Korean company Rophibio by acquiring a minority stake, which
was facilitated by the recapitalization of its newly established subsidiary, ALKALOID Pharma
International in Croatia. This investment in South Korea amounting to 1 million USD will provide
ALKALOID AD with an ownership share in the company and the right of first refusal when
licensing products in its operating regions.
Considering the market potential and the expertise of the Rophibio team, ALKALOID AD has
decided to invest in this research and development company, which is currently in the advanced
stages of developing biosimilar drugs.",Алкалоид АД Скопје,ALK,Neutral

No. 3, 1000 Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia, with Corporate Registration No. 4065573 (hereinafter referred to as ""Bidder""), in accordance with Article 47 of the Law on Takeover of Joint Stock Companies (Official Gazette of RNM No. 69/2013, 188/2013, 166/2014, 154/2015, 23/2016, 248/2018 and 31/2020), hereby announces the following:

	INFORMATION ON THE OUTCOME OF THE TAKEOVER BID

	published in the daily newspaper ""Sloboden pechat"" on 26.08.2024 and

	 in the Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia No. 177 as of 26.08.2024

	
		The Takeover Bid was accepted by 149 (one hundred and forty-nine) holders of ordinary shares with voting rights that own a total of 176,154 ordinary shares, i.e. 45.0548% of all shares with voting rights issued by Stopanska Banka AD Bitola.


	
		The Takeover Bid referred to all 390,977 ordinary shares with voting rights issued by Stopanska Banka AD Bitola with ISIN number: MKSBTB101013.


	
		In the Takeover Bid, the success threshold - i.e. the minimum number of ordinary shares which had to be accepted in order for the Takeover Bid to be considered as successful - was set at 261,956 ordinary shares with voting rights, which represents 67% plus 1 share of the total number of ordinary shares with voting rights issued by Stopanska Banka AD Bitola.


	Taking into consideration that the success threshold requirement has not been met, the Takeover Bid for Stopanska Banka AD Bitola by Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje is considered unsuccessful. The reason for this is that sufficient number of shareholders who own ordinary shares with voting rights did not respond positively to the Bank's bid, i.e. they did not give a Statement for accepting the purchase bid at a price of MKD 3,200 per share within the legally prescribed deadline until 22.09.2024.

	Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje would like to wish a lot of success to the shareholders of Stopanska Banka AD Bitola in their future operations.

Comment on the unconsolidated and unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period of 01.01 - 30.09.2024
1. Income Statement
In the period of 01.01-30.09.2024, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial
result from its operations in an amount of MKD 4,422.6 million compared to the positive
financial result from the same period last year in the amount of MKD 3,047.7 million, noting
an increase by 45.1%. The planned gross profit for the three quarters of the year is realized by
139.3%. The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's operational
capability to cover the operating expenses, has increased by 36.4% compared to the same
period last year. The increase of profit realized before provisioning is mainly due to the
increased other operating income as well as the increased net interest income, and to a lesser
extent due to the increased net fee and commission income and net trading income. The more
significant increase of other operating income compared to the same period last year is a result
of the increased income from capital gains from the sale of foreclosed property, as well as the
increased amount of collected previously written-off claims.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 6,626.4 million and notes an
increase by 29.5% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income and as at 30.09.2024, notes an increase by 16.2% compared to the same period last
year. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by 113.4%. Interest income notes an increase
by 20.0% as a result of increased placements across all customer categories, whereas a trend
of decrease of interest rates compared to the same period last year is evident only within the
non-residents sector due to the decrease of the three nominal interest rates by the ECB. Within
the rest of the sectors, higher interest rates still persist compared to the same period last year,
in conditions of initiated relaxation of the monetary policy by NBRNM1. Interest expenses have
increased by 58.7% due to the increased time deposits compared to the same period last year.
The net interest margin at Bank’s level has increased from 3.56% at the end of the third quarter
of 2023, to 3.87% as at 30.09.2024.
As at 30.09.2024, the net fee and commission income amounts to MKD 876.0 million and
compared to the same period last year notes an increase by 9.9%, mostly as a result of the
increase in the volume of operations, especially in cards operations. The plan for the analyzed
period is realized by 106.2%.
The net FX gains as at 30.09.2024 amount to MKD 268.0 million and note a small decrease
by 1.2% compared to the same period last year. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by
109.6%.
Other operating income of the Bank as at 30.09.2024 is in the amount of MKD 987.8 million
and notes a more significant increase compared to the same period last year, as a result of the
multiple increase in income from capital gains from the sale of foreclosed property, and to a
lesser extent due to the increased amount of collected previously written-off claims. The income
from the sale of foreclosed property from the debtors Euronikel Industri DOO Vozarci,
Kavadarci and Nova Refraktori DOO Pehcevo recorded in April 2024 has the largest share
within the income from sale of foreclosed property and equipment. The plan is realized by
176.2%.

The ECB has reduced the three nominal interest rates on three occasions (in June, September and October) by 25
percentage points each. NBRNM has reduced the interest rate on treasury bills in September 2024 also by 25
percentage points at the level of 6.05%, as compared to 6.30% in September 2023. Interest rates on overnight and 7-
day deposits remained at the same level as in September 2023.

	Makedonski Telekom AD Skopje publishes the Annual Report on the Operations for 2023.

MAKEDONSKI TELEKOM AD – SKOPJE
Address: Kej 13 Noemvri 6, 1000 Skopje, R. North Macedonia
ANNUAL REPORT
on the Operations of Makedonski Telekom AD - Skopje in 2023
This Annual Report on Operation refers to Makedonski Telekom AD - Skopje (hereinafter referred to as: “MKT”).
In 2023, the Macedonian economy was confronted with significant challenges marked by a slow economic growth and a
deceleration in inflation, which, despite the decrease, remains at a relatively high level. Although fiscal and monetary
actions have been put in place in order to offset the challenges posed by the geo-economic crisis, the growing
dependency on energy imports, the structural economic weaknesses and the high inflation rate are eroding the
purchasing power and the business confidence.
Despite operating in a challenging economic environment with aggressive competition, MKT achieved year-over-year
growth by increasing the revenues which resulted in a higher net margin and lower costs, primarily due to the reduced
electricity expenses. The mobile segment, and especially the post-paid services, drove higher revenues, supported by an
increased subscriber base and increased revenue per subscriber. The fixed revenues saw a growth from the broadband
and TV services, interconnection, and TV content resale. At the same time, the system integration revenues declined.
MKT plans to sustain its positive performance from 2023 by leveraging the integrated offers, focusing on service revenue
growth, strengthening its position in the ICT market amid the growing digitization demands, expanding the next-
generation networks, and maintaining its status as a premium provider.
MKT registered a customer base growth in all three focus segments – post-paid, BB internet and TV customers. At the
end of 2023, MKT had 228 thousand stable fixed line voice accesses. The number of total broadband (BB) subscribers
increased to 210 thousand at the end of 2023, marking a 3.5% year-over-year increase. The number of IPTV customers
at the end of 2023 reached 150 thousand customers, marking a 1.8% increase from the end of 2022. The number of
Fibre to the Home (FTTH) customers reached 113 thousand at the end of 2023, marking a 14% increase from the end of
2022.
MKT had 1,281 thousand mobile subscribers at the end of 2023, or a 1% increase compared to 2022. The mobile
market penetration in the Republic of North Macedonia is 127%. As a result of the market saturation, MKT continuously
focuses on retaining the customers in order to protect the market share.
MKT has built a substantial advantage on the market in terms of FMC penetration. MAGENTA 1 continued to be MKT’s
main product, offered both in the consumer and in the business segment. The positive value generation from the
converged households, the simplification of the product propositions and the digital customer experience were the main
guiding directions in 2023.
Focus is constantly put on the migration to the next generation integrated gigabit networks (FTTH and 5G) and the
dedication to deliver best customer experience, which resulted with the prestigious Ookla award for the best mobile
network based on the data from Speed-test Intelligence referring to the superior speed of the mobile network, the largest
coverage of the territory of Macedonia and the best quality of the network.
During 2023 within the ESG agenda (Environment, Society and Governance), MKT managed to further reduce the CO2

ALKALOID COMMISSIONS NEW CAPITAL PROJECT WORTH €19.4 MILLION
The recent construction of solid pharmaceutical form manufacturing facilities covering an area of 6200
square meters, marks the most significant investment made by the company in the past two decades.
Committed to continuous modernization and expanding manufacturing capacities, volume, and product
range, Alkaloid AD Skopje has recently completed its most substantial investment venture in the past two
decades. This project involved the establishment of an advanced facility for manufacturing solid
pharmaceutical forms, known as ""Tablet Department 2.0,"" along with its accompanying technical
infrastructure.
The new technical and technological infrastructure, designed to more than double the production volume
and enhance the flexibility of solid pharmaceutical form manufacturing, spans 6200 square meters,
encompassing both production and technical facilities. Alkaloid invested a total of 19.4 million euros in
this endeavor. The building construction, which commenced in April 2021, engaged 30 local and 16
international companies. Alkaloid AD Skopje's professional departments oversaw both the construction
and furnishing processes. The facilities were constructed to adhere to the stringent standards for good
manufacturing practices, with all processes fully integrated and digitized. All data from process controls
are automatically generated.
The newly established facility for manufacturing solid pharmaceutical forms will produce tablets, film-
coated tablets, capsules, and double-layered tablets, introducing this manufacturing technology to
Macedonia for the first time. These are tablets that contain multiple active ingredients with various
chemical and physical properties or release methods. They are carefully and precisely dosed, with the
active ingredients physically separated to maintain stability and effectiveness, enabling patients to receive
comprehensive therapy from multiple medications in a single tablet. The solid pharmaceutical form
manufacturing equipment was procured from globally recognized manufacturers: GEA for wet granulation
equipment, Alexanderwerk for dry granulation equipment, Lodige for homogenization equipment, Fette
for tablet presses, Glatt for the film coating system, De Lama for the automatic container washing
machine, among others.
Upon commissioning the new technical and technological unit for manufacturing solid pharmaceutical
forms, production capacity has doubled. Previously capable of producing 2 billion tablets annually, the
projected manufacturing capacity now exceeds 4 billion tablets per year.
""In our dynamic pharmaceuticals industry, sales are typically directly linked to investment, skills, and
knowledge. Over the past two decades, our focus has centered on constructing a modern and competitive
product portfolio. Our commitment remains unwavering: to distinguish ourselves through developing
knowledge and value-added products. Looking ahead, we are resolute in staying this course, further
globalizing the Alkaloid brand with dignity and dedication by practicing high ethical standards, credibility,
and a professional approach across all our operations"" - noted Zhivko Mukaetov, the CEO and President
of the Management Board, during the official launch of the new department, attended by senior company
management and media representatives from both the country and the region.
This marks one of the most significant investment endeavors undertaken by Alkaloid AD in the last two
decades. In 2005, the company recorded sales totaling 53.1 million euros, a figure that surged to 268.3
million euros by 2023, marking a five-fold increase. Alongside this consistent growth over the past 15
years, investments exceeding 220 million euros were realized.
Alkaloid's pharmaceutical products are available in over 40 countries worldwide.",Алкалоид АД Скопје,ALK,Neutral

Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 - 30.06.2024
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-30.06.2024, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial
result from its operations in an amount of MKD 2,844.6 million compared to the positive
financial result from the same period last year in the amount of MKD 2,003.3 million, noting
an increase by 42.0%. The planned gross profit for the first half of the year is realized by
134.4%. The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's operational
capability to cover the operating expenses, has increased by 46.0% compared to the same
period last year. The increase of profit realized before provisioning is mainly due to the
increased other operating income as well as the increased net interest income, and to a lesser
extent due to the increased net fee and commission income and net trading income. The more
significant increase of other operating income compared to the same period last year is a result
of the increased income from capital gains from the sale of foreclosed property.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 4,503.8 million and notes an
increase by 36.5% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income and as at 30.06.2024 notes an increase by 22.2% compared to the same period last
year. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by 113.0%. Interest income notes an increase
by 27.6% across all customer categories: within the financial institutions sector due to the
increased interest rates on treasury bills and deposits placed with NBRNM1, within the
government sector due to increased investments in government securities with increased
interest rates2, within the non-financial legal entities sector due to increased lending, within the
households sector due to increased loan placements and within non-residents due to increased
placements in foreign banks and increased interest rates3. Interest expenses have increased
by 90.5% due to the increased time deposits and increased deposit interest rates compared to
the same period last year. The net interest margin at Bank’s level has increased from 3.43% at
the end of the first half of 2023, to 3.88% as at 30.06.2024.
As at 30.06.2024, the net fee and commission income amounts to MKD 611.8 million and
compared to the same period last year notes an increase by 13.7%, mostly as a result of the
increase in the volume of operations, especially in cards operations. The plan for the analyzed
period is realized by 111.2%.
The net FX gains as at 30.06.2024 amount to MKD 180.4 million and note an insignificant
decrease by 0.6% compared to the same period last year. The plan for the analyzed period is
realized by 110.7%.
Other operating income of the Bank as at 30.06.2024 is in the amount of MKD 731.8 million
and notes an increase by more than 4 times compared to the same period last year, which is
almost entirely a result of the significant increase in capital gains from the sale of foreclosed
property. The income from the sale of foreclosed property from the debtors Euronikel Industri

weighted interest rate on government securities is calculated according to the yield rate, it has reached
3.72% on June 30, 2024, as opposed to 2.81% on June 30, 2023.
3 The average weighted interest rate on deposits in foreign banks as at June 30, 2024 reached 4.42%,
compared to 4.22% as at June 30, 2023.

of the previous year.
At the end of the first six months of 2023, the revenues from mobile retail voice and mobile non-voice

to post migration as well as the lower spending of voice services in the pre-paid segment. There is increase
of the revenues from non-voice services mostly as a result of the increased revenues from mobile internet
due to higher usage of bundled tariff models with non-voce services as well as the increased GPRS traffic
in roaming.

by 1.4% compared to the same period of the previous year.

	Comments to the (unaudited) nonconsolidated financial statements of NLB Banka AD Skopje for the period 01.01.-30.09.2023.

Analysis of the financial results of NLB Bankа Skopje
for the period 01.01 – 30.09.2023
In the period from 01.01.2023 to 30.09.2023, NLB Banka Skopje worked in accordance with the
adopted Business Policy of the Bank for 2023.
In the analyzed period, the Bank made a net profit in the amount of 2,435,542 thousand MKD,
which represents an increase of 19.1% compared to the net profit realized in the same period of
the previous year. The increase is due to continuous sales activities of credit products with a
special focus on households, micro, small and medium enterprises as well as an increased
number of users of the Bank's payment services.
In the first half of the year, NLB Banka received three recognitions from card partner Visa - one
of the world's largest payment networks and a global brand in digital payments - one for
exceptional business performance and two recognitions for outstanding Visa sponsorships: for
the world cup in Qatar, as well as for the latest film production of Milcho Manchevski, ""Kajmak"".
For the donation intended for the suffering population after the earthquakes in Syria and Turkey,
at the solemn ceremony on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the existence of Red Cross
organization of RNM, NLB Banka was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation for contribution,
demonstrated humanity and solidarity. Additionally, NLB Banka for the 7th time received the
""Bank of the Year 2022 in Macedonia"" award given by the renowned magazine EMEA Finance,
which is a significant confirmation of the successful operations of the Bank.
The bank is a systemically significant bank based on the Decision on the methodology for
identifying systemically significant banks of the National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia,
with a strong market position and a high market share in the banking sector of the Republic of
North Macedonia.
Balance sheet
As of September 30, 2023, the balance amount is 110,515,649 thousand MKD, it has decreased
by 2,182,374 thousand MKD or 1.9% compared to December 31, 2022.
Cash and cash equivalents amount to 20,879,206 thousand MKD and are increased by 0.1%
compared to 31.12.2022.
Loans and receivables from banks recorded a decrease of 476 thousand MKD compared to
31.12.2022.
Total loans to the non-banking sector amount to 72,248,825 thousand MKD and show an
increase of 1.7% compared to 31.12.2022. The increase stems from an increase in lending to
household sector by 6.9% compared to 31.12.2022 as a result of an increase in consumer and
housing loans.
Investments in securities amount to 14,722,435 thousand MKD and have decreased by 10.2%
compared to 31.12.2022 due to less investment in government bonds.
The foreclosed assets have decreased by 98,604 thousand MKD compared to 31.12.2022.
The total deposits (deposits of clients and deposits of banks) amount to 88,045,409
thousand MKD and compared to 31.12.2022 have decreased by 2.7%. The decrease is due to a
more pronounced decrease in business bank accounts of households by 5.2% and non-financial
legal entities by 4.8%.
Borrowings and subordinated debt were reduced by 195,242 thousand MKD due to a reduction

Comment on the unconsolidated unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 - 30.06.2023
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-30.06.2023, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial result from
its operations in the amount of MKD 2,003.3 million compared to the positive financial result from the
same period last year in the amount of MKD 1,127.3 million, noting an increase by 77.7%. The planned
gross profit for the first half of the year is realized by 131.4%. The profit realized before provisioning, which
is an indicator of the Bank's operational capability to cover the operating expenses, has increased by 50.4%,
compared to the same period last year. The increase is mainly due to the increased income from regular
operations, i.e. net-interest income, which notes a significant increase as a result of the continuous increase
in the nominal interest rate of the National Bank and the interest rates in foreign financial markets, combined
with the structure of the Bank's assets. The increase of the interest rates is a result of the worldwide efforts
to reduce inflation. The positive result of the Bank's operations was achieved in conditions of increased
uncertainty linked to the events on the international financial markets (especially due to the developments
in the US and Swiss banking systems), high inflation rates that are still present, but record a slight
slowdown, as well as further tightening of the monetary policy.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 3,300.3 million and notes an increase by
32.0% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating income and
as at 30.06.2023 notes an increase by 82.1%, compared to the same period last year, under the influence
of the tightened monetary policy and the increased interest rates. Thus, it should be pointed out that the
biggest impact on the increase of the interest income has the growth of the interest income from non-
residents, financial entities and from the government sector. Although an increase has been realized in
interest income of the loans to legal entities and households, it is on a lower scale compared to the previous
categories. For example, the increase in interest income earned from the financial entities, where
placements in treasury bills and deposits in NBRNM are dominant, are eleven times higher, while for non-
residents, where dominant are the placements in foreign banks, they are almost nine times higher than the
income earned in the same period last year. In the first half of the previous year, a cycle of tightening of the
monetary policy began through the increase of the interest rates, both in EU and the US, and in our country.
Thus, the Euribor interest rate, which in the first half of 2022 was around 0% or negative, reached around
3.5% - 4% this year. Regarding the treasury bills, the interest rate began to increase in April 2022 and on
30.06.2022 was 2.00%, while on 30.06.2023 it reached 6.00%. Simultaneously, the Central Bank was
increasing the interest rates on the deposits placed overnight and up to 7 days, whereby it increased from
0.40% and 0.45% respectively in June 2022, to 3.90% and 3.95% respectively in June 2023. The interest
rate on the government bills increased from 0.40% to 4.00%, or 5.25% at the two-year government bonds,
up to 7.00% with the latest Eurobond. In addition, the average weighted interest rate on deposits in foreign
banks as at 30.06.2023, compared to the same period last year, has increased from 1.50% to 4.22%. That
is why, the total interest income from financial entities and non-residents is significantly higher than the
interest income from individuals in the Bank's Income Statement. Also, the total interest income from the
financial entities, non-residents and the government sector are higher than the interest income from legal
entities. The Bank achieved these results thanks to the structure of the assets, in which over 55% of the
placements are in cash, cash equivalents and investments in securities, which influenced the maintenance
of high liquidity and interest income profitability. As a result of these movements, the net-interest margin at
the Bank’s level increased from 2.0% in the first half of last year, to 3.43% on 30.06.2023.",Комерцијална Банка АД Скопје,KMB,Positive

Comment on the unconsolidated unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 - 30.09.2023
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-30.09.2023, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial result from
its operations in the amount of MKD 3,047.7 million compared to the positive financial result from the
same period last year in the amount of MKD 1,850.8 million, noting an increase by 64.7%. The planned
gross profit for the three quarters of 2023 is realized by 133.2%. The profit realized before provisioning,
which is an indicator of the Bank's operational capability to cover the operating expenses, has increased
by 49.5%, compared to the same period last year. The increase is mainly due to the increased income from
regular operations, i.e. net-interest income, which notes a significant increase as a result of the continuous
growth in the nominal interest rate of the National Bank and the interest rates in foreign financial markets,
combined with the structure of the Bank's assets. The increase of the interest rates is a result of the
worldwide efforts to reduce inflation. The positive result of the Bank's operations was achieved in conditions
of increased uncertainty linked to the developments on the international financial markets, high inflation
rates that are still present but record a slight slowdown, as well as further tightening of the monetary policy.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 5,115.7 million and notes an increase by
31.6% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating income and
as at 30.09.2023 notes an increase by 80.7%, compared to the same period last year. Thus, it should be
pointed out that although growth is evident in all interest income categories, the increase in interest income
from financial entities has the biggest impact on the increase of total interest income, and to a lesser extent
it is due to the increase in interest income from non-financial entities, non-residents and the government
sector. For example, the increase in interest income earned from the financial entities, where placements
in treasury bills and deposits in NBRNM are dominant, are nine times higher, while for non-residents, where
the placements in foreign banks are prevailing, they are five times higher than the income earned in the
same period last year. In the course of 2022, a cycle of tightening of the monetary policy began through the
increase of the interest rates, both in EU and the US, and in our country. Thus, the Euribor interest rate,
which in the third quarter of 2022 was minimally under 0% or around 2% with the 12-month Euribor, has
reached around 3.5% - 4% in the same period this year. Regarding the treasury bills, the interest rate began
to increase in April 2022 and on 30.09.2022 was 3.00%, while on 30.09.2023 it reached 6.30%.
Simultaneously, the Central Bank was increasing the interest rates on the deposits placed overnight and
up to 7 days, whereby they have increased from 0.90% and 0.95% respectively in September 2022, to
4.20% and 4.25% respectively in September 2023. The interest rate on the government bills has increased
from 0.40% in the period January-September 2022 to 4.25% in the same period this year, or 5.25% with
the two-year government bonds, up to 7.00% with the Eurobonds. In addition, the average weighted interest
rate on deposits in foreign banks as at 30.09.2023, compared to the same period last year, has increased
from 2.39% to 4.49%. Therefore, the total interest income from financial entities and non-residents is
significantly higher than the interest income from households in the Bank's Income Statement. Also, the
total interest income from the financial entities, non-residents and the government sector are higher than
the interest income from legal entities. The Bank achieved these results thanks to the structure of the
assets, in which more than 56% of the placements are in cash, cash equivalents and investments in
securities, which influenced the maintenance of high liquidity and interest income profitability. As a result
of these movements, the net-interest margin at the Bank’s level increased from 2.10% at the end of the
third quarter last year, to 3.56% as at 30.09.2023.",Комерцијална Банка АД Скопје,KMB,Positive

In the period from 1.1.2023 to 30.06.2023, NLB Banka Skopje worked in accordance with the
adopted Business Policy of the Bank for 2023.
In the analyzed period, the Bank made a net profit in the amount of 1,451,175 thousand MKD,
which represents an increase of 4.0% compared to the net profit realized in the same period of
the previous year. The increase is due to continuous sales activities of credit products with a
special focus on households, micro, small and medium enterprises as well as an increased
number of users of the Bank's payment services.
In the first half of the year, NLB Banka received three recognitions from card partner Visa - one
of the world's largest payment networks and a global brand in digital payments - one for
exceptional business performance and two recognitions for outstanding Visa sponsorships: for
the world cup in Qatar, as well as for the latest film production of Milcho Manchevski, ""Kajmak"".
For the donation intended for the suffering population after the earthquakes in Syria and Turkey,
at the solemn ceremony on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the existence of Red Cross
organization of RNM, NLB Banka was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation for contribution,
demonstrated humanity and solidarity. Additionally, NLB Banka for the 7th time received the

Balance sheet
As of June 30, 2023, the balance amount is 110,737,217 thousand MKD, it has decreased by
1,960,806 thousand MKD or 1.7% compared to December 31, 2022.
Cash and cash equivalents amount to 18,930,828 thousand MKD and are decreased by 9.2%
compared to 31.12.2022.

31.12.2022.
Total loans to the non-banking sector amount to 72,119,035 thousand MKD and show an
increase of 1.5% compared to 31.12.2022. The increase stems from an increase in lending to
household sector by 4.4% compared to 31.12.2022 as a result of an increase in consumer and
housing loans.
Investments in securities amount to 15,476,813 thousand MKD and have decreased by 5.6%
compared to 31.12.2022 due to less investment in treasury bills.
The foreclosed assets have decreased by 10,6% compared to 31.12.2022.
The total deposits (deposits of clients and deposits of banks) amount to 89,424,891
thousand MKD and compared to 31.12.2022 have decreased by 1.2%. The decrease is due to a
more pronounced decrease in business bank accounts of non-financial legal entities by 10.3%.
Borrowings and subordinated debt were reduced by 180,269 thousand MKD due to a reduction
in the amount of borrowings from the DBNM credit line.

	Alkaloid AD Skopje Makes a Groundbreaking Achievement with the World's First Patent for Liquid Omeprazole

Alkaloid AD Skopje Makes a Groundbreaking Achievement in Treating Reflux Esophagitis and
GERD with the World's First Patent for Liquid Omeprazole
In recent years, Alkaloid has embarked on a process of redesigning existing generic pharmaceutical
products for new indications. The goal was to develop drugs with added value that address the treatment
and fulfill the needs of individual or specific patient groups. Strategic investments aimed at modernizing
the product portfolio resulted in the successful development of Alkaloid's first patented value-added drug.
This drug is primarily designed to treat reflux esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in
young children unable to swallow tablets, as well as in adult patients who have difficulty swallowing
(dysphagia patients) and those with an inability to swallow (gastric feeding tube patients and/or geriatric
patients).
These conditions are some of the most common in gastroenterohepatology, manifested by the return of
gastric acid into the esophagus, leading to discomfort and possible long-term complications. Proton pump
inhibitors, including Omeprazole, are the preferred medications for treating reflux esophagitis and GERD.
These medications are typically available in the form of gastro-resistant tablets and capsules, as well as
powder for dissolution. In a groundbreaking discovery, Alkaloid has developed ready-to-use liquid
Omeprazole for the first time in history.
The novelty of this Alkaloid product lies in enclosing two separate solutions in a dual-chamber package.
Upon opening, these solutions automatically mix to provide ready-to-use liquid Omeprazole. The product
has a pleasant lemon and menthol flavor and is free from sugar, sorbitol, and artificial coloring. To
accommodate the specific requirements of this drug’s manufacturing process, the company invested in a
custom-built machine tailored to this innovative product, ensuring an efficient and sustainable global supply
chain.
Alkaloid obtained the first international value-added medicine (VAM) patent for the Omeprazole peroral
solution. The first marketing authorizations for this groundbreaking medication have been granted for both
the Macedonian and UK markets. Registration processes are underway for European countries and
European Union markets, with the anticipation of obtaining marketing authorizations and subsequent
product launch.
This product underscores Alkaloid's dedication to excellence in the pharmaceutical industry, marking a
milestone in generic drug manufacturing through innovation, market differentiation and catering to specific
patient groups. At present, the company's development laboratories are actively working on several other
innovative formulations.",Алкалоид АД Скопје,ALK,Positive

period from 01.01.2023 until 31.03.2023
The following analysis refers to the Unaudited Income Statement of Makedonski Telekom (MKT) for the
period 01.01.2023 - 31.03.2023, prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs).
I Revenues
The sales revenues at the end of the first three months of 2023 amounted to MKD 2,881,658 thousand,
which represents increase by 3.7% compared to the same period of the previous year.
Mobile services
Mobile voice and non-voice services
On the mobile market, MKT has a market share of 48.7% (internal estimation, compared to 48.5% at the
end of the same period of the previous year). The subscribers’ base at the end of the first three months of
2023 amounts to 1,253 thousand subscribers and it is increased by 3.3% compared to the same period
of the previous year.
At the end of the first three months of 2023, the revenues from mobile retail voice and mobile non-voice
services marked an increase by 5.8% compared to the same period of the previous year.
The increase is mainly due to the higher number of post-paid subscribers, as well as increase of the
roaming revenues due to reduction of the restrictions related to COVID – 19 pandemics, and on the other
hand there is decline of the revenues from pre-paid mostly due to pre to post migration as well as the lower
spending of voice services in the pre-paid segment. There is increase of the revenues from non-voice
services mostly as a result of the increased revenues from mobile internet due to higher usage of bundled
tariff models with non-voce services as well as the increased GPRS traffic in roaming.
The revenues from wholesale voice services at the end of the first three months of 2023 marked a decrease
by 4.6% compared to the same period of the previous year.

Comment on the unconsolidated and unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 - 31.03.2024
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-31.03.2024, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial
result from its operations in the amount of MKD 1,179.1 million compared to the positive
financial result from the same period last year in the amount of MKD 1,039.7 million, noting
an increase by 13.4%. The planned gross profit for the first quarter of the year is realized by
111.4%. The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's operational
capability to cover the operating expenses, has increased by 32.8% compared to the same
period last year. The increase is mainly due to the increased income from regular operations
(net interest income and net fee and commission income) and to a lesser extent, also due to
increased other income. The Bank achieved this as a result of the increased placements in low-
risk securities and increased lending, as well as the persistent high share of placements in cash
and cash equivalents, which contributed to realizing increased interest income in conditions of
higher interest rates compared to the same period last year.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 1,998.6 million and notes an
increase by 26.5% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income and as at 31.03.2024 notes an increase by 26.8% compared to the same period last
year. Interest income notes an increase by 34% across all customer categories: within the
financial institutions sector due to the increased interest rates on treasury bills and deposits
placed with NBRNM1, within the government sector due to increased investments in
government securities with increased interest rates2, within the non-financial legal entities
sector due to increased lending, within the households sector due to increased loan placements
and within non-residents due to increased placements in foreign banks and increased interest
rates3. Interest expenses have increased by 130.3% due to the increased time deposits and
increased deposit interest rates compared to the same period last year. The net interest margin
at Bank’s level has increased from 3.3% in last year’s first quarter, to 3.94% in the same period
this year.
As at 31.03.2024, the net fee and commission income amounts to MKD 336.5 million and
compared to the same period last year notes an increase by 25.6%, mostly as a result of the
increase in the volume of operations, especially in cards operations. The plan for the analyzed
period is realized by 122.3%.
The net FX gains as at 31.03.2024 amount to MKD 96.6 million and are close to the same
level as the same period last year. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by 118.5%.
Other operating income of the Bank as at 31.03.2024 is in the amount of MKD 86.5 million
and notes an increase by 29.9%, mainly as a result of the realized capital gains from the sale
of foreclosed property, as well as higher amount of collected previously written-off receivables
compared to the same period last year. The plan is realized by 46.5%.
1 The interest rate on treasury bills in March 2024 was 6.30%, as opposed to 5.50% in March 2023, while
the interest rate on overnight and up to 7 days deposits in March 2024 was 4.20% and 4.25% respectively,
as opposed to 3.40% and 3.45% in March 2023.
2 The average weighted interest rate on government securities as at March 31, 2024 reached 3.81%
(calculated according to coupon interest) as opposed to 3.22% as at March 31, 2023. If the average
weighted interest rate on government securities is calculated according to the yield rate, it has reached
3.71% on March 31, 2024, as opposed to 2.70% on March 31, 2023.
3 The average weighted interest rate on deposits in foreign banks as at March 31, 2024 reached 4.74%,
compared to 4.39% as at March 31, 2023.

Comment on the unconsolidated unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 - 31.12.2023
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-31.12.2023, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a profit before tax from its
operations in the amount of MKD 3,912.6 million compared to MKD 2,311.0 million in 2022, noting an
increase by 69.3%. The planned profit for 2023 is realized by 128.3%. The profit tax in 2023 amounts to
MKD 331.2 million, while the net profit for 2023 is in the amount of MKD 3,581.4 million, i.e. an increase by
66.6%, compared to the previous year. The positive result of the Bank's operations was achieved in
conditions of increased uncertainty related to the developments on the international financial markets at the
beginning of the year (especially due to the developments in the banking systems in the USA and
Switzerland), increased geopolitical risks enhanced by the new Israel-Hamas crisis and the continuous
tightening of the monetary policy in the first three quarters of 2023, which resulted in an expected slowdown
of inflation towards the end of the year, but it still persisted at an average annual level of 9.4%, that is
significantly above the target set at around 2%.
The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's operational capability to cover
the operating expenses, has increased by 41.4% compared to last year. This increase is mainly due to the
increased income from regular operations, i.e. net-interest income, which notes a significant increase as a
result of the continuous growth of the nominal interest rate of the National Bank and the interest rates in
foreign financial markets, combined with the structure of the Bank's assets. The increase of the interest
rates in the reporting period was a result of the worldwide efforts to reduce inflation.
The net impairment of financial assets as at December 31, 2023, is in the amount of MKD 766.9 million
compared to MKD 994.0 million in 2022, which is a decrease by 22.9%. The decrease in the net impairment
of financial assets is a result of the successful overcoming of macroeconomic shocks related to price
pressures in the energy sector and the normalization of the operations of certain companies - clients of the
Bank, which faced difficulties last year. In addition, considering the operating circumstances of the client
with significant exposure, EURONIKEL INDUSTRI DOO Kavadarci, which could not regularly service its
obligations due to the unfavorable trends in the metal processing industry, at the end of the year the Bank
made a decision to foreclose the company’s property in order to find a fast and efficient solution for
restarting production. This decision contributed to maintaining the net impairment of financial assets at a
moderate level.
The total operating income realized in 2023 is in the amount of MKD 7,067.1 million and notes an increase
by 28.1% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating income and
as at 31.12.2023 notes an increase by 68.2%, compared to the previous year. The plan is realized by
147.9%. Thus,it should be pointed out that although growth is evident in all interest income categories, the
increase in interest income from financial entities has the biggest impact on the increase of total interest
income, and to a lesser extent it is due to the increase in interest income from non-financial entities, non-
residents and the government sector. For example, the increase in interest income earned from the financial
entities where placements in treasury bills and deposits in NBRNM are dominant, is five times higher, while
for non-residents, where the placements in foreign banks are prevailing, is more than three times higher
than the income earned last year. In the course of 2022, a cycle of tightening of the monetary policy began
through the increase of interest rates, both in EU and the US, and in our country. Thus, the Euribor interest",Комерцијална Банка АД Скопје,KMB,Positive

Comment on the unconsolidated unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 - 31.03.2023
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-31.03.2023, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial
result from its operations in the amount of MKD 1,039.7 million compared to the positive
financial result from the same period last year in the amount of MKD 522.6 million, noting an
increase by 98.9%. The planned gross profit for the first quarter of the year is realized by
136.4%. The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's operational
capability to cover the operating expenses, has increased by 67.9%, compared to the same
period last year. The increase is mainly due to the increased income from regular operations,
i.e. net-interest income, which notes a significant increase as a result of the continuous increase
in the nominal interest rate of the National Bank and the interest rates in foreign financial
markets, combined with the structure of the Bank's assets. The increase of the interest rates is
a result of the worldwide efforts to reduce inflation. The positive result of the Bank's operations
was achieved in conditions of increased uncertainty on the markets, high inflation rates that are
still present, but record a slight slowdown, as well as further tightening of the monetary policy.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 1,580.3 million and notes an
increase by 40.6% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income and as at 31.03.2023 notes an increase by 82.6% compared to the same period last
year. Thus, it should be pointed out that as a result of the tightening of monetary policy and
increased interest rates, a growth in interest income under loans approved to legal entities and
individuals was achieved, but this increase is significantly, even several times lower than the
increase in interest income from non-residents, financial entities and even the government
sector. For example, the increase in interest income earned from financial entities, where
placements in treasury bills and deposits in the NBRNM are dominant, are eleven times higher,
while for non-residents, where dominant are the placements in foreign banks, they are more
than fourteen times higher than the income earned in the same period last year. This is due to
the fact that in the first quarter of 2022, the Euribor interest rate was around 0% or negative,
and this year it reached around 3.5% - 4%. The interest rates on treasury bills have risen from
1.25% to the latest 5.50%, and on government bills from 0.40% to 3.70%, or 5.25% on two-
year government bonds, up to 7.14% with the latest Eurobond. In addition, the average
weighted interest rate on deposits in foreign currency, compared to the same period last year,
has increased from 0.25% to 4.39%, while the average weighted interest rate on placements
with the NBRNM from 0.31% to 3.63%. That is why, for the first time, the total interest income
from financial entities and non-residents is significantly higher than the interest income from
individuals in the Bank's balance sheet. Or else, the total interest income from financial entities,
non-residents and the government is significantly higher than the interest income from legal
entities. The Bank achieved these results thanks to the structure of the assets, in which over
55% of the placements are in cash, cash equivalents and investments in securities, which
influenced the maintenance of high liquidity and interest income profitability. As a result of these

first quarter, to 3.3% in the same period of this year.
As at 31.03.2023, the net fee and commission income amounts to MKD 267.9 million and

	Komercijalna Banka would like to inform the public about ongoing negotiations with several investors for the purchase of Euronikel's property and equipment

	However, due to the confidentiality of the negotiation process with potential investors, the Bank is not in the position to share more information at the moment with regard to this process.

	Given that in recent days several media have expressed their interest in the procedure for selling Euronikel’s property and equipment, Komercijalna Banka would like to inform the general public that negotiations with several interested investors are underway, centered on the purchase of Euronikel’s property and equipment, currently foreclosed assets of the Bank.

	However, due to the confidentiality of the negotiation process with potential investors, the Bank is not in the position to share more information at the moment with regard to this process.

	Furthermore, it is expected that any potential buyer of Euronikel's property and equipment will also need employees to implement the production process.

	Komercijalna Banka would especially like to underline that the possible initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against Euronikel has no links to and points of contact with the Bank's possession of the foreclosed property and equipment. This property and equipment shall under no circumstance be part of the bankruptcy proceedings and Komercijalna Banka may freely sell them without any limitations whatsoever.

Analysis of the financial results of NLB Bankа AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 – 31.03.2023
In the period from 1.1.2023 to 31.03.2023, NLB Banka Skopje worked in accordance with the
adopted Business Policy of the Bank for 2023.
In the analyzed period, the Bank made a net profit in the amount of 802,487 thousand MKD, which
represents an increase of 22.8% compared to the net profit realized in the same period of the
previous year. The increase is due to continuous sales activities of credit products with a special
focus on households, micro, small and medium enterprises as well as an increased number of
users of the Bank's payment services.
In the first quarter of the year, NLB Banka received three recognitions from card partner Visa -
one of the world's largest payment networks and a global brand in digital payments - one for
exceptional business performance and two recognitions for outstanding Visa sponsorships: for
the world cup in Qatar, as well as for the latest film production of Milcho Manchevski, ""Kajmak"".
For the donation intended for the suffering population after the earthquakes in Syria and Turkey,
at the solemn ceremony on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the existence of Red Cross
organization of RNM, NLB Banka was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation for contribution,
demonstrated humanity and solidarity.
The bank is a systemically significant bank based on the Decision on the methodology for
identifying systemically significant banks of the National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia,
with a strong market position and a high market share in the banking sector of the Republic of
North Macedonia.

compared to 31.12.2022 as a result of an increase in consumer and housing loans.
Investments in securities amount to 15,832,271 thousand MKD and have decreased by 3.4%

end of the same period of the previous year). The subscribers’ base at the end of the first nine months of

of the previous year.
At the end of the first nine months of 2023, the revenues from mobile retail voice and mobile non-voice
services marked an increase by 4.4% compared to the same period of the previous year.
The increase is mainly due to the higher number of post-paid subscribers, as well as increase of the
roaming revenues, and on the other hand there is decline of the revenues from pre-paid mostly due to pre
to post migration as well as the lower spending of voice services in the pre-paid segment. There is increase
of the revenues from non-voice services mostly as a result of the increased revenues from mobile internet
due to higher usage of bundled tariff models with non-voce services as well as the increased GPRS traffic
in roaming supported by increase in content revenue.

by 0.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.

Comment on the unconsolidated unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 - 30.09.2022
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-30.09.2022, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial
result from its operations in the amount of MKD 1,850.8 million compared to the positive
financial result from the same period last year in the amount of MKD 1,355.1 million,
representing an increase of 36.6%. The planned gross profit for the three quarters of the year
is realized by 105%. The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's
operational capability to cover the operating expenses, is increased by 9.2% compared to the
same period last year. The decrease in profit realized before provisioning is mainly due to the
decrease in income from capital gains from the sale of foreclosed assets and a decrease in
collected previously written off receivables, while income from regular operations (net-interest
income, net-income from fees and commissions, and net-FX gains) notes an increase. The
Bank achieved the positive result in conditions of still present risks related to the future course
of the pandemic, increased inflation which triggered a tightening of monetary policy, an energy
crisis, and a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which are all expected to have
adverse effects on the global economy.
The total income realized is in the amount of MKD 3,887.7 million and notes an increase of
10.6% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income and as at 30.09.2022 is in the amount of MKD 2,118.9 million, noting an increase of
16.4% compared to the same period last year mainly as a result of an increased lending to the
nonfinancial entities and the households, due to the increased interest rates of the treasury bills
and the loan placements in NBRNM, increased interest rates and increased placements in
domestic and foreign banks and increased investment in government securities. The plan for
the analyzed period is realized by 109.4%.
The net income from fees and commissions, as at 30.09.2022, amounts to MKD 778.9
million and compared to the same period last year notes an increase of 4.4%, as a result of
increased scale of realized activities. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by 102.9%.
The net FX gains as at 30.09.2022 are in the amount of MKD 226.9 million and note an
increase of 69.7%, mainly due to a significantly increased turnover with corporate clients on the
FX market. The plan for the period is realized by 180%.
Other operating income of the Bank as at 30.09.2022 is in the amount of MKD 761.2 million
and notes a minimal increase of 0.6% mainly as a result of a reduction in realized income from
capital gains from the sale of foreclosed assets and collected written off receivables. The plan
is realized by 89.4%.
Operating expenses for the period 01.01-30.09.2022 are in the amount of MKD 1,482.6 million
and compared to the same period last year have increased by 13% as a result of an increase
in material expenses due to the increased cost of electricity, increased depreciation and
voucher based donations in sports, as well as increased insurance premiums for deposits. The
plan is realized by 101%.
In the period 01.01-30.09.2022, the Bank has recorded impairment losses on non-financial
assets on net basis in the amount of MKD 7.5 million.

At the end of the first nine months of 2022, the revenues from mobile retail voice and mobile non-voice
services marked an increase by 6.7% compared to the same period of the previous year.

roaming revenues due to reduction of the restrictions related to COVID – 19 pandemics, and on the other
hand there is decline of the revenues from pre-paid mostly due to pre to post migration as well as the lower
spending of voice services in the pre-paid segment. There is increase of the revenues from non-voice
services mostly as a result of the increased revenues from mobile internet due to higher usage of bundled
tariff models with non-voce services as well as the increased GPRS traffic in roaming.

by 13.2% compared to the same period of the previous year.

program ""Green Energy"" which is designed for household investments in energy

On the mobile market, MKT has a market share of 48.4% (internal estimation, compared to the 47.7% at
the end of the same period of the previous year). The subscribers’ base at the end of the first six months of
2022 amounts to 1,233 thousand subscribers and it is increased by 12.2% compared to the same period
of the previous year.
At the end of the first six months of 2022, the revenues from mobile retail voice and mobile non-voice
services marked an increase by 8% compared to the same period of the previous year.
The increase is mainly due to the higher number of post-paid subscribers, as well as increase of the
roaming revenues due to reduction of the restrictions related to COVID – 19 pandemics, and on the other
hand there is decline of the revenues from pre-paid mostly due to pre to post migration as well as the lower
spending of voice services in the pre-paid segment. There is increase of the revenues from non-voice
services mostly as a result of the increased revenues from mobile internet due to higher usage of bundled
tariff models with non-voce services as well as the increased GPRS traffic in roaming.
The revenues from wholesale voice services at the end of the first six months of 2022 marked a decrease
by 9.5% compared to the same period of the previous year.
The blended ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for voice and nonvoice services marked a decrease by
4.6% compared to the same period of the previous year amounting to MKD 372 mostly driven by the lower
spending of voice services in the pre-paid segment.

increased number of users of the Bank's payment services. In the reporting period, the
Bank signed a new agreement with EBRD for a credit line from the financing program
""Green Energy"" which is designed for household investments in energy efficiency.
In the first quarter of 2022, the first NLB electronic banking assistant NELA was

In the analyzed period, the Bank realized net profit in the amount of 1,395,014

the same period last year. The increase is due to the continuous sales activities of loan
products with special focus on households, micro, small and medium enterprises and
an increased number of users of the Bank's payment services. In the reporting period,
the Bank signed a new agreement with EBRD for a credit line from the financing
program ""Green Energy"" which is designed for household investments in energy
efficiency.

NLB Banka received a national award by the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of
North Macedonia for social responsibility and recognition for the most innovative
practice for the ""NLB Framework for Assistance"" project.
Confirmation of the effective operation of NLB Banka AD Skopje so far includes the
three recognitions received by the Bank from the Visa Centre, as a Bank showing
outstanding results, not only in the Republic of Macedonia, but also throughout South-
Eastern Europe. These recognitions confirms the size of the partnerships the Bank
builds, the commitment of business and customers and the support it gives to the
community in which it operates.
The Bank is a systemically important bank based on the Decision on a methodology
for identifying systemically important banks of the National Bank of the Republic of
N.Macedonia with a strong market position and a high market share in the banking
sector of the Republic of N.Macedonia.
NLB Banka AD Skopje is characterized with high capital adequacy, more than double
the regulatory prescribed and significant upward trend on the profitable side of the
Bank.

As of 30.06.2022, the balance amount amounts to 106,429,308 thousand MKD, ie

	Makedonski Telekom AD Skopje publishes the Annual Report on the Operations for 2021.

MAKEDONSKI TELEKOM AD – SKOPJE
Address: Kej 13 Noemvri 6, 1000 Skopje, R. North Macedonia
ANNUAL REPORT
on the Operations of Makedonski Telekom AD - Skopje in 2021
This Annual Report on Operation refers to Makedonski Telekom AD - Skopje (hereinafter referred to as: “MKT”).
After a heavily affected economy by the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020, the recovery already visible in 2021 resulted in open
borders and an increased mobility during the summer season.
The revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 is higher, mostly driven by the mobile service revenue, as well as broadband and
TV revenues, following a continuing expansion of the customer base. The fixed revenues are higher, driven by the higher
revenues from fixed services (broadband, TV and data) and TV content resale (no further sports TV content exclusivity on
the market), partially offset by the lower interconnection revenues. In the mobile segment, the positive trend is coming from
post-paid and prepaid services followed by a higher subscriber base and a higher ARPU per subscriber. To sustain the
positive performance recorded in 2021, MKT intends to further leverage the integrated offers by creating additional value
(“more 4 more” approach) and ensure the growth the service revenue, strengthen the position in ICT market as a result of
an accelerated demand for digitization, continue with the penetration of the next generation networks, and keep the market
position as a premium provider.
At the end of 2021, MKT had 224 thousand voice access fixed lines, marking a 1.3% increase from the end of 2020. The
number of total broadband (BB) subscribers increased to 197 thousand at the end of 2021, marking a 3.2% year-over-year
increase. The number of IPTV customers at the end of 2021 reached 146 thousand customers, marking a 2.4% increase
from the end of 2020. The number of Fibre to the Home (FTTH) customers reached 86 thousand at the end of 2021,
marking a 16.6% increase from the end of 2020.
MKT had 1,215 thousand mobile subscribers at the end of 2021, or a 10% increase compared to 2020. The mobile market
penetration in the Republic of North Macedonia is 107%. As a result of the market saturation, MKT continuously focuses on
retaining the customers in order to protect the market share.
MKT registered a customer base growth in all three focus segments – post-paid, BB internet and TV customers, thus
keeping the position of the largest TV operator in North Macedonia (in terms of TV customer base).
MKT has built a substantial advantage on the market in terms of FMC penetration. MAGENTA 1 continued to be MKT’s
main product, offered both in the consumer and in the business segment. The positive value generation from converged
households, simplification of the product propositions and the digital customer experience were the main guiding
directions in 2021.
Starting from 1st July, WB6 regulation for RLAH (Roam Like at Home) between 6 Balkan countries was introduced, offering a
possibility to post-paid customers to use a part of the national internet data bundle & voice minutes included in the package
for communication in roaming, without an additional charge.
MKT has demonstrated to society its continuous work in the spirit of the slogan “We won’t stop until everyone is connected”
by providing the best connectivity and customer experience, and helping to transform and digitize the public sector with
more “Smart City” projects & digital solutions. The customer support is shifting towards digital channels, especially via the

	ALKALOID AD Skopje Registers New Company in Romania

ALKALOID AD Skopje Registers New Company in Romania
Following its long-term development and business strategy, pursuing its key strategic decisions on
the globalization of the ALKALOID brand, and aiming to strengthen its exporter position,
especially in the European Union, ALKALOID’s management has decided to open a new EU
subsidiary, this time in Romania.
As more than 65% of the company's production goes for exports, being present in the EU markets
and expanding to new ones is exceptionally important. The newly opened company is the seventh
established in an EU member country.
After years of presence on the Romanian market, ALKALOID AD Skopje registered its company
Alkaloid Bucharest S.R.L. The company has an initial capital of 100.000 EUR and is wholly
owned by ALKALOID AD Skopje.
ALKALOID is present in Romania with its pharmaceutical products, as well as the hemodialysis
line consisting of several product groups. In 2021 ALKALOID had 212,5 million Denars in sales
in Romania and in the first half of 2022 sales in this market went up 140% compared to the same
period from 2021.
Registering the new company is another step towards achieving ALKALOID’s main strategic goal
of becoming a stable export-oriented company.",Алкалоид АД Скопје,ALK,Positive

Comment on the unconsolidated unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period 01.01 - 31.12.2022
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-31.12.2022, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a profit before tax
from its operations in the amount of MKD 2,311.0 million compared to MKD 2,504.6 million in
2021, representing a decrease of 7.7%. The planned profit for the analyzed period is realized
by 98.3%. Profit tax in 2022 amounts to MKD 161.8 million, while net profit for the year reported
is in the amount of MKD 2,149.2 million, i.e. a decrease by 6.7%, compared to the last year.
The positive result of the Bank's operations was achieved in a year of crisis in which the risks
related to the Covid-19 pandemic were still present, while the economy was also affected by
shocks related to the energy crisis and increased inflation as a result of the armed conflict
between Russia and Ukraine. These conditions encouraged a tightening of the monetary policy
by the National Bank for the purposes of price growth stabilization, preventing further
downgrading of the population’s purchasing power, as well as providing greater predictability
in the companies’ decision making process.
The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's operational capability
to cover the operating expenses, is decreased by 3.8%, compared to the same period from the
previous year, mainly due to the reduced collected previously written off receivables and
reduced income from capital gains from the sale of foreclosed assets. On the other hand,
income from regular operations (net-interest income, net-income from fees and commissions,
and net-FX gains) notes an increase as a result of the achieved solid growth of the business
activities realized by the Bank in conditions of crisis.
The net impairment of financial assets, as at December 31, 2022, stood at MKD 994.0 million
compared to MKD 934.6 million in 2021, noting an increase of 6.4%. The increase in the net
impairment of financial assets is due to the increased volume of lending, but also due to a more
stringent credit risk assessment approach by the Bank's management resulting in a larger
amount of provisions set aside for the corporate portfolio due to the unfavorable conditions in
the economy. At the same time, during the last quarter of 2022, the Bank determined a
substantial additional impairment of financial assets, primarily for clients experiencing a long
term standstill in their production processes due to high energy prices or due to temporary
measures of relevant judicial authorities resulting in temporary freezes of financial assets of
certain clients.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 5,518.0 million and notes an
increase by 0.8% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income and as at 31.12.2022 amounts to MKD 3,095.4 million, noting an increase of 26.1%.
The increase in net interest income is mainly the result of increased lending to non-financial
entities and households, increased interest rates of Treasury Bills and deposits placed with the
National Bank, increased interest rates and placements in domestic and foreign banks, as well
as increased investment in government securities. The plan for the analyzed period is realized
by 119.9%.
The net income from fees and commissions as at 31.12.2022 amounts to MKD 1,068.3
million and compared to the same period last year notes an increase by 7.4% mainly due to an
increase in the volume of operations. The plan for the period analyzed is realized by 105.9%.
The net FX gains as at 31.12.2022 amount to MKD 336.3 million and note an increase of
70.4%, in large part due to increased F/X operations with companies. The plan for the period
is realized by 200.2%.

D E C I S I O N
on utilization and distribution of the

1. Dividend on ordinary shares MKD 1.139.533.500
2. Reserves MKD 849.653.331

of the Bank, and thus exercising the right to reduce the tax base for the
Income tax. The profit that is distributed in retained earnings for investments
is included in the calculation of the regular share capital of the Bank and

Comment on the unconsolidated unaudited Income Statement and Balance
Sheet of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje for the period 01.01 - 31.03.2022
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-31.03.2022, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial
result from its operations in the amount of MKD 522.6 million compared to the positive
financial result from the same period last year in the amount of MKD 360.2 million,
representing an increase of 45.1%. The planned gross profit for the first quarter of the year is
realized by 89%. The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's
operational capability to cover the operating expenses, is increased by 1.1% compared to the
same period last year. The increase in profit realized before provisioning is mainly due to the
increase in income from regular operations (net-interest income and net-income from fees and
commissions). The Bank achieved the positive result in conditions of still present risks related
to the future course of the pandemic, increased inflation at the beginning of the year which
exceeds projections, an energy crisis, and a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine,
which are all expected to have adverse effects on the global economy.
The total income realized is in the amount of MKD 1,124 million and notes an increase of 6.7%
compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income and as at 31.03.2022 notes an increase by 9.6% compared to the same period last
year mainly as a result of an increase in interest income from loans to nonfinancial entities, the
state and households, due to increased lending. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by
97.6%.
The net income from fees and commissions, as at 31.03.2022, amounts to MKD 250.8
million and compared to the same period last year notes an increase by 4%. The plan for the
analyzed period is realized by 99.4%.
The net FX gains as at 31.03.2022 amount to MKD 57.3 million and note an increase of 36.9%.
The plan for the period is realized by 136.4%.
Other operating income of the Bank as at 31.03.2022 is in the amount of MKD 186.9 million
and notes a decrease by 0.4% mainly as a result of a reduction in realized income from capital
gains from the sale of foreclosed property, while income from collected written off receivables
note an increase. The plan is realized by 66.1%.
Operating expenses for the period 01.01-31.03.2022 are in the amount of MKD 471.5 million
and compared to the same period last year have increased by 15.6% as a result of an increase
in the salaries and other employees’ expenses due to a 5% rate increase in the salaries’ grading
since the beginning of the year, increased depreciation, insurance premiums for deposits and
voucher based donations in sports, etc. The plan is realized by 100.6%.
In the period 01.01-31.03.2022, the Bank has recorded impairment losses on non-financial
assets on net basis in the amount of MKD 1.1 million.
In the reporting period, the Bank recorded an impairment of financial assets and special
provision for off-balance sheet exposures on net basis in the amount of MKD 128.8 million,
compared to MKD 283.7 million in the same period last year.

Comment on the unconsolidated unaudited Income Statement and Balance
Sheet of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje for the period 01.01 - 31.12.2021
1. Income Statement
In the period 01.01-31.12.2021, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a profit before tax
from its operations in the amount of MKD 2,504.6 million compared to MKD 2,067.1 million in
2020, representing an increase of 21.2%. The planned profit for the analyzed period is
realized by 127.1%. Profit tax in 2021 amounts to MKD 200.3 million, while net profit for the
year reported is in the amount of MKD 2,304.3 million, i.e. an increase by 20.5% compared to
last year.
The Bank achieved this solid result from its operations due to the gradual recovery of the
economy from the consequences related to the health and economic crisis caused by the
Covid-19 virus, positively affected by the start of the population vaccination process and the
global economic recovery. At the same time, during 2021, the risks and uncertainties related
to the intensity and duration of the pandemic, as well as to the economic recovery conditioned
by the stagnation in the global supply chains, high rise in energy prices, and inflationary
pressures, remained present.
The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's operational
capability to cover the operating expenses, is increased by 0.1% compared to the same
period from the previous year on account of increased income from regular operations, while
other income is reduced due to the decrease in income from capital gains from the sale of
foreclosed assets (MKD 444.1 million in 2021, as opposed to significantly higher income in
the amount of MKD 1,334.4 million in 2020, owing in large part to the sale of foreclosed
property previously owned by clients Prototip DOOEL Skopje, Tehnometal Vardar AD Skopje
and FKN Negotino).
The net impairment of financial assets, as at December 31, 2021, stood at MKD 934.6
million and compared to the same period last year, when it amounted to MKD 1,369.7 million,
notes a decrease of 31.8%. The decrease in the net impairment of financial assets is due to
previously anticipated deterioration of a proportion of the corporate loan portfolio as a
consequence of Covid-19 crisis developments in 2020, while in the reporting period there
were positive developments in the economy and in the Bank's portfolio.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 5,473.1 million and notes an
increase of 1.6% compared to the same period last year due to increased income from
regular operations.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income. As at 31.12.2021, it amounts to MKD 2,454.6 million, noting a decrease of 1.5%
realized in conditions of reduced interest rates on loans and deposits, a moderately increased
volume of lending as well as significantly increased deposits. Additionally, compared to last
year, net interest income was also affected by reduced interest rates of and placements in
Treasury Bills. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by 95.5%.
The net income from fees and commissions as at 31.12.2021, amounts to MKD 994.8
million and compared to the same period last year notes an increase by 11.5% on account of
a lower basis for comparison during the same period in the previous year, when, because of
the declared pandemic and the countrywide lockdown, the Bank's activities registered a
significant decrease. The plan for the period analyzed is realized by 117.7%.
The net FX gains as at 31.12.2021 amount to MKD 197.4 million and note an increase of
19.6%. The plan for the period is realized by 119.6%.
Other operating income of the Bank as at 31.12.2021 is in the amount of MKD 1,723.9
million and notes a decrease mainly as a result of a reduction in realized income from capital
gains from the sale of foreclosed property. Within this position, the Bank realized a significant

Mobile services
Mobile voice and non-voice services
On the mobile market, MKT has a market share of 48.6% (internal estimation, compared to 49.8% at the
end of the previous year). The subscribers’ base at the end of 2022 amounts to 1,268 thousand subscribers
and it is increased by 4.3% compared to the previous year.
At the end of 2022, the revenues from mobile retail voice and mobile non-voice services marked an
increase by 6.9% compared to the previous year.
The increase is mainly due to the higher number of post-paid subscribers, as well as increase of the
roaming revenues due to reduction of the restrictions related to COVID – 19 pandemics, and on the other
hand there is decline of the revenues from pre-paid mostly due to pre to post migration as well as the lower
spending of voice services in the pre-paid segment. There is increase of the revenues from non-voice
services mostly as a result of the increased revenues from mobile internet due to higher usage of bundled
tariff models with non-voce services as well as the increased GPRS traffic in roaming.
The revenues from wholesale voice services at the end of 2022 marked a decrease by 12.4% compared
to the previous year.
The blended ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for voice and nonvoice services marked a decrease by
3.9% compared to the previous year amounting to MKD 372 mostly driven by the lower spending of voice
services in the pre-paid segment.
